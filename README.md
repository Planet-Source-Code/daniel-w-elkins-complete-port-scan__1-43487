### Description

This scans a port on a range of IP addresses. It can resolve the hostnames of each IP it scans using the DNS ActiveX control (included). It formats the results and displays them in a listview control. This program is simple, and effecient [ I hope ;) ]. And I do not take ANY credit whatsoever for the DNS ActiveX control, it was a good control I found for free while surfing the web; although I cannot remember the name of the website I got it from; but all credit for that goes to it's author. Comments, threats, are always welcome. =)
